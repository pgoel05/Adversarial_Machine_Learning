## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Welcome to my research repository that focuses on assessing adversarial network robustness. The project explores GoogLeNet, SqueezeNet, and ResNet-50 modelsâ€™ performance against Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Basic Iterative Method (BIM) attacks. I've evaluated model accuracies with a dataset of 50 randomly selected images from ImageNet and use the Grad-CAM technique to visualize image focus regions under different attack scenarios.

## Setup <a name="setup"></a>

- MATLAB R2023a (Apple Silicon)
- The dataset consists of 50 images from the ImageNet dataset.

## Results <a name="results"></a>

The evaluation results compare the performance of models under FGSM and BIM attacks with epsilon values. The accuracy scores are presented graphically, and Grad-CAM visualizations highlight the regions that influence model decisions. A bar graph summary of accuracy scores is provided, with readers directed to the visualization section for a deeper understanding.

## Initial Tasks <a name="initial-tasks"></a>

Before delving into the project, there are a few initial tasks to complete. Ensure you follow the steps to set up your environment, complete OnRamps training [here](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/), and install MATLAB [here](https://uk.mathworks.com/downloads/) with the Deep Learning Toolbox. These tasks are crucial for a smooth start to the project.
